# Instructions for Using the BMI Calculator Program

To run the program, type in "python BMICalculator.py" or "python3 BMICalculator.py" (if version 3 needs to be specified) into the Terminal or GitBash window.

## Interface

When the program is run, the following is printed:

```
Welcome to the BMI Calculator!
Options:
1 - BMI Check
9 - Quit
Enter your choice:
```

To proceed, the user can enter '1' to access the BMI calculator; otherwise, the user can enter '9' to exit the program.

## BMI Data Entry (Weight & Height)

If the former is chosen, the user is prompted to input a weight either in kilograms or pounds. As mentioned in the prompt, the user should be entering the weight in a specified format (eg. XX lb or XX kg):

```
Enter your weight in kg/lb (eg. 130 lb):
```

After the weight is entered, the user is then prompted to input a height either in meters or inches. The format is similar to that for weight:

```
Enter your height in m/in (eg. 65 in):
```

## BMI Calculation and Output

After these two values are entered, the program automatically calculates the value of the BMI index as well as the associated category (shown below). BMI is calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (taken from: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_bmi/childrens_bmi_formula.html)

Underweight:    BMI < 18.5 <br/>
Normal weight:  18.5 <= BMI < 25 <br/>
Overweight:     25 <= BMI < 30 <br/>
Obese:          30 < BMI <br/>

The results are then printed along with the entered weight and height, an example of which is shown below:

```
The entered weight is 125 lb
The entered height is 63 in
The calculated BMI is 22.142466726102995
The result is normal weight
```
